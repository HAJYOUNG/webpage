  <p> The Piano Concerto No. 5 in E♭ major, Op. 73, by Ludwig van Beethoven, popularly known as the Emperor Concerto, was his last completed piano concerto. It was dedicated to Archduke Rudolf, Beethoven's patron and pupil. The title 'Emperor' seems to have stuck from the earliest performances of Beethoven’s music, although I doubt it’s a name he’d have given to a concerto which has been described as the embodiment of Romantic conflict. A very real conflict certainly had an impact on Beethoven’s writing in 1809, but given the way we know Beethoven felt about the Emperor Napoleon, it’s hardly a title he would have chosen. There are a number of stories about how this, his fifth piano concerto, got its name. </p>
