  <p> This song was dedicated by Beethoven to a man named Ferdinand Waldstein, so the subtitle became Waltstein.

Meanwhile, the Waldstein sonata originally had a separate second movement, but acquaintances and publishers suggested that the song was too long and that the second one was not in harmony with the other two. In response to this opinion, Beethoven removed the second movement and replaced the second movement with a short prelude to the third movement, which became the second movement. The excluded second movement was published separately under the title "Andante Favori, WoO 57"
