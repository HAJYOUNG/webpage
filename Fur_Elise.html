  <p> This music is famous with that Beethoven composed this music for his lover. And there are several candidates for the muse of this music. It is widely acknowledged that Therese, perhaps the true dedicatee of ‘Für Elise’, was Therese Malfatti, a woman to whom Beethoven proposed in 1810 – the same year he composed ‘Für Elise’. She was also the owner of the manuscript.

However, other researchers have suggested Elise could have been a German soprano named Elisabeth Röckel.  Röckel played Florestan in Beethoven’s opera Fidelio, and many sources show that Elisabeth often met with Beethoven, who fell in love with the young woman and wanted to marry her.

And there is also a third candidate: another German soprano and friend of Beethoven called Elise Barensfeld.
