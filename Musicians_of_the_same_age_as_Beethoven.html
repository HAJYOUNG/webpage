<p><strong>Mozart</strong>(1756-1791)</p>
<p>Arguably the most gifted musician in the history of classical music.
   His inspiration is often described as 'divine', but he worked assiduously, not only to become the great composer he was, but also a conductor, virtuoso pianist, organist and violinist.
   Mozart's music embraces opera, symphony, concerto, chamber, choral, instrumental and vocal music, revealing an astonishing number of imperishable masterpieces.</p>

ReiÂ´chardt  1752-1814 German

Marschner   1795-1861 German
Lortzing    1801-1851 German

etc.
</p>
<h3><em>Romantic Realism & Late Romanticism</em></h3>
<p>From Beethoven, I will say that it is completely different from Schumann's musical fantasy.
  Among the three, the intentions were different and there is a wide gap between Berlioz and Wagner.
  At that time, this new field of title music was not just a musician, but also a subject of deep interest among writers and aesthetics.</p>
