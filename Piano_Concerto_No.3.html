  <p> "Concerto no. 3 in C minor for piano and orchestra op. 37, finished in 1800, clearly outlines Beethoven’s creative path, revealing works of great value and confirming the creative genius of the composer. The third piano concerto is the first one to use a minor key and the first one that clearly separates Beethoven from the classical music. In this concerto, the composer produced a more varied and dynamic work rich in the turbulent emotions for which he was becoming known. The piano style was suddenly less ornate, more muscular, as if he’d decided that he didn’t have to conform to established standards and had immediately set about challenging the capabilities of the then current instruments. </p>
