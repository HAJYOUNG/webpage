  <p> Sonata in F minor op. 57 also known under the title of "Appassionata" was composed by Beethoven in 1804, but was only recorded in 1806. The theme of the finale was composed during a stroll in the surroundings of Dobling. The sonata was dedicated to Franz Brunswick, Thereza’s brother. It is one of the sonatas characterized by organic unity of the constituting parts, thus allowing the public to understand the meaning of the work. In Appassionata, Beethoven rendered the richness of nature’s forces and the immense power of man who manages to overcome it. </p>
